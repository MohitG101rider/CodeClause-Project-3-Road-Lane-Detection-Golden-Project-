# Road Lane Detection using OpenCV â€“ CodeClause Internship

# ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project detects road lanes in real-time from video input using **Python** and **OpenCV**. It applies image processing techniques like **Canny edge detection** and **Hough Line Transform** to identify lane markings on the road.  

This project was developed as part of the **CodeClause Internship** program to explore fundamental computer vision concepts used in self-driving car technology.

# Also uploading videos to test the project - vid1,vid2,challenge.


# ðŸš€ Features

- Detects road lanes from a given video feed.
- Uses **Canny edge detection** for detecting lane boundaries.
- Applies **Gaussian blur** to reduce noise.
- Uses **Hough Line Transform** to highlight lane lines.
- Works on sample road videos or can be extended to live dashcam footage.
- Lightweight and easy to run on most systems.

# ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python 3.9+
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
